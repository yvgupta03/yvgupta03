# Hi, Myself Yash 👋
- Automation Enthusiast 🌟
- RPA (Robotic Process Automation) Practioner 🤖
- AI and DevOps aspirant 🚀

## Who am I?
I am someone who likes to interact with multiple technologies and to be a key player in between all the critical tasks that are being handled in projects. My conviction says that we can work practice and update our knowdledge by ourselves but the true essense of shaping a good career only comes through problem solving at an industrial stage of project. My work at github are simply my experiments to understand the technologies of my interests.

### I’m currently working on 🔭 
- Jobs: I am looking for RPA and software development roles
- Learning: Good frameworks for web-dev and trying different applications of AI/ML
- Personal projects: Some magic is brewing in my brain🧠 regarding a music application 🎵🎻🎹 and a cool DSA project 🖥️

### My 2 cents on Automation:
---
> It not that simple, like some piece of cake.
> You will only have dimple, until you start to bake.
>
> There is a lot of work for automation's sake.
> Don't forget the ones who built it without break.
> Because its automation's job to make, make & make.
> But it only exists for humans to take.
